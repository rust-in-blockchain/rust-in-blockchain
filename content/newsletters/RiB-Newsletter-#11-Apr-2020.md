Welcome to the #11 edition of Rust in Blockchain, the hypest newsletter about the hypest tech. [Previous: #10](/newsletters/2020-04-01-keep-calm-and-hack-more).

Wow, it was a huge month for blockchain Rust! It seems like we've all been
productive sitting at home hacking. We've seen so many interesting developments,
hopefully we captured them all in this report. Really, it has been overwhelming
trying to pull together all the content and contributions this month. It's
amazing!

There were significant developments for several Rust blockchain projects:

- NEAR [launched their mainnet][nmn]. Congrats to the NEAR team!
- The [Ethereum 2.0 "Schlesi" multi-client testnet launched][eth2], with the
  Rust [lighthouse][lh] client participating.
- Facebook's Libra resurfaced with a [new roadmap and whitepaper][lbr].
- [MobileCoin], a fast and privacy-focused payment network associated with
  [Signal], open-sourced their Rust codebase. MobileCoin runs the Stellar
  consensus protocol in SGX enclaves, combined with CryptoNote ring signatures.

[lh]: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse

We learned of new, or new-to-us Rust blockchain and crypto projects:

- [BLAKE3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3), a new BLAKE-family hash
  function, with a Rust implementation.
- [Distaff](https://ethresear.ch/t/introducing-distaff-a-stark-based-vm-written-in-rust/7318), a STARK VM that runs
  encrypted computations.
- [Crypto.com Chain](https://github.com/crypto-com/chain), a new chain
  using Tendermint consensus.
- Both IPFS and FileCoin have ongoing Rust implementations: [ipfs-rust]
  and [forest].
- [Komodo's AtomicDEX][adex], seemingly one of the most functional
  implementations of cross-chain atomic swaps, is written in Rust (or is being
  rewritten in Rust).

Virtual conferences have been flourishing. There were at least three online blockchain conferences, the materials for which should be available:

- [Ready Layer One][rlo]. NEAR, Polkadot, Solana, Nervos, and Oasis represented.
- [DeFi Discussions][dfd]. Not Rust-specific, though lots of talks,
  and Enigma is represented.
- [Sub0][sub0]. A Substrate conference.

Encouraging things are happening in the Rust security and cryptography space.
The [RustSec] project has been accelerating, releasing [5 Rust-related security
advisories in April][rsad]; and the [RustCrypto] organization released [new
secp256k1 curve implementations][rca1] and [ed25519 signature
implementations][rca2], among others. This and other activity we've seen
recently from the [Rust secure code working group][scwg] has been encouraging
and exciting.

This was also a big month for RiB. Lots of people submitted news and project
updates. Thank you so much! It really improves the quality and breadth of our
project coverage.

We now have automation to collect project stats from GitHub (the "merged PR's"
etc. listed for each project, and the "Most Active Projects" section). This will
help us reduce the effort that goes into producing each newsletter, and as a
result we no longer need help collecting those stats (we do though very much
need help choosing important news, blogs, pulls, and issues for each project).

Since our project coverage has become quite expansive, this month we have moved
the "Interesting Things" section in front of "Project Updates". This section
contains links about cross-cutting topics that we hope are of interest to the
broadest technical Rust audience. We expect this section to expand in the future
to cover subjects like cryptography, security, consensus, WASM and other VMs,
and crypto-economics, particularly as related to Rust and the Rust blockchain
ecosystem.

Let us know what you think in the [telegram group][tg]. Let's have another great
month, Rusty crypto hackers.

## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain project. This month that project is…

The [`k256`] crate!

This is a pure-Rust implementation of [secp256k1], the elliptic curve used by
Bitcoin and many other blockchain projects. It was one of several cryptography
projects announced this month by Tony Arcieri, a maintainer of the [RustCrypto]
GitHub org, and leader of the Rust [secure code working group][scwg].

In addition to `k256`, RustCrypto also released [`p256`], an implementation of
the [NIST P-256] curve, [`signature`], a crate for generically verifying
cryptographic signatures, and [`ed25519`], an implementation of the [Ed25519]
signature scheme.

See the announcments of [`k256` and `p256`][rca1] and [`signature` and
`ed25519`][rca2] for more links and commentary.
