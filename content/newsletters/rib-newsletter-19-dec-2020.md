Welcome to the #19 edition of Rust in Blockchain,
the hypest newsletter about the hypest tech.
[Previous: #18](/newsletters/on-to-the-ribbles/).

It was a super uneventful December in the Rust blockchain world.
Not a lot of GitHub activity,
not a lot of technical blog posts to report.

But, in a seemingly monthly tradition,
a Rust blockchain launched a mainnet:
this time it's [MobileCoin][mcl],
a fast and private payment network,
that uses a combination of [CryptoNote],
[RingCT], and the [Stellar Consensus Protocol],
all inside of [SGX enclaves].
Congrats to the MobileCoin team.

Since there's not much else of note this month,
let's survey a topic that's been on our minds recently:
Rust and smart contracts.

There are a number of blockchains that either
run smart contracts written in Rust,
or implement their smart contract runtimes
or languages in Rust.
They fall into a few categories:

- Those that support Rust compiled to WASM, like [Elrond], [Holochain], [NEAR],
  [Secret Network], [Substrate].

  These mostly have similar programming models, influenced by Solidity, and all
  have SDKs for Rust:
  Elrond's [elrond-wasm-rs],
  [Holochain's HDK][hrust],
  [NEAR's SDK][nrust],
  Secret Network's [secret-toolkit],
  and Substrate's [Ink].

- Those that support Rust compiled to other VMs, like [Nervos] (RISC-V),
  and [Solana] (eBPF).

  Nervos contracts are programmed in Rust with their [Capsule] library. Besides
  being the only blockchain running RISC-V, Nervos is also a rare
  smart-contract capable blockchain using the UTXO model instead of the account
  model.

  Solana runs an especially eccentric VM: [eBPF]. Originally designed as a
  non-Turing-complete interpreter for running inside OS kernels, eBPF is slowly
  finding its way into other applications. Did you know Rust supports eBPF?
  Neither did we! But it kinda does, or LLVM has a backend for it at least; and
  while Rust doesn't officially seem to have _any_ in-tree eBPF support, Solana
  has hacked together a working Rust->eBPF toolchain that includes a [fork of
  the Rust compiler with eBPF support][rebpf]. Fascinating! Upstream that code,
  Solana! Of course, with eBPF not supporting loops, the Rust here must be quite
  interesting.

- Those that use Rust to implement a smart-contract language, like [Solang] (a
  Solidity to WASM compiler), [Leo] (a zero-knowledge language), and [Move]
  (Diem's language).

  Although many chains are moving toward general-purpose VMs, particularly to
  WASM, there are reasons not to, the main two being: wanting Ethereum
  EVM compatibility, and being based on zero-knowledge proofs. Move is
  a relatively rare case in that it is both its own language, and
  its own VM, but does not share the obvious reason to have a custom VM
  that zero-knowledge languages do.

It is notably impossible to write Rust contracts that target Ethereum's EVM,
which is of course the dominant smart contract platform. Maybe eventually
somebody will write an LLVM backend for EVM, and we can change that.

In RiB news, as we've mentioned in the past, sometimes we receive inquiries
about purchasing ads in RiB. We want to try this, but also to ensure RiB remains
a welcoming place for technical discussion and news (and not a cryptocurrency
marketing website), and that income generated by RiB supports the broader Rust
blockchain community. As such, it is now possible for relevant parties to
sponsor RiB in exchange for ad placement on the website, or for a prominent
thanks and blurb in the newsletter. Half of sponsorship income is reserved for
the [RiB community fund][cfund]. Details of the program are on the
website's [sponsorship page][spons]. This is our first time running such a program and feedback is
welcome in the [Telegram group][tg] or privately [by email][em].

## Thanks

Thanks to contributors:

[Adam Gutierrez][contributor-ag],
[Paulii][contributor-pa],
[Brian Anderson][contributorba], and [Aimee Zhu][contributoraz].
Thank you for your help!

RiB needs help to keep up with Rust blockchain projects. 
If you follow a particular project, or otherwise find information 
that is beneficial to the Rust & blockchain community, 
please contribute to the next issue
by submitting a PR to the [#20 draft](https://github.com/rust-in-blockchain/Rust-in-Blockchain/tree/master/draft).

## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain project. This month that project is…

[Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang)

Solang is a Solidity compiler implemented in Rust,
but it does not target the Ethereum EVM.
Instead it uses LLVM as a backend,
which means it can potentially target most blockchains that do _not_ run EVM.
Currently that includes Substrate, Solana, [ewasm], and [Sawtooth].
