Welcome to the #20 edition of Rust in Blockchain,
the chillest newsletter about the chillest tech.
[Previous: #19](/newsletters/rust-and-smart-contracts/).

Within the blockchain industry and without,
the rate of Rust job postings appears to be on a steady rise,
and every month we come across interesting new Rust gigs.
New public job postings are listed
in the "Careers" section in this newsletter,
while previously-open listings are on the website [job board][page-jobboard].
It's a good time to be a skilled Rust programmer,
especially for those of us into blockchain tech.

For those wanting to stay the most up to date with what's going on,
the pace of the RiB [Telegram group][ribtg] has been picking up lately,
and the announcements and discussions there are more detailed
than the brief one-liners in the newsletter.

Representatives from Rust blockchain projects will often hop in and link to
developer tools, events, and jobs.
While we usually include these links in the newsletter,
we also generally strip out the details and nuance of the message.

This month we talked a lot about Rust smart contract platforms,
including the possibility of creating a single Rust library that abstracts
over multiple blockchain runtimes.

Still, it is a low-volume group that only permits developer-relevant content &mdash;
typical blockchain marketing spam is moderated away.

On that note, we welcome [Ilya] as our new administrator.
Ilya's vigilance is one of the reasons there's so little spam in the group.

## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain project. This month that project is…

[mev-inspect](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-rs)

This is a tool for analyzing historical miner extractable value (MEV) on Ethereum.
"Miner extractable value" refers to value that can be earned by miners directly from transactions,
through e.g. mempool frontrunning,
as opposed to traditional miner rewards.
It was defined and analyzed in the [Flashboys 2.0 paper][fb2],
which claims that the phenomenon poses near-term system risk to Ethereum's
security by skewing the economic incentives of miners in unanticipated ways.
`mev-inspect` then is a tool designed to illuminate how bots
today are competing with each other to squeeze value out of Ethereum transactions.

It can introspect transactions with common DeFi applications,
including Uniswap, Aave, and Curve,
to find instances of arbitrage, liquidations, and other front-runnable activites.

It is described further in [a post on the Ethereum research forum][mevpost].

`mev-inspect` communicates with Ethereum nodes via the [ethers crate][ethers].
