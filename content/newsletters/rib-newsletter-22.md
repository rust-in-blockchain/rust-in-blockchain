Welcome to the #22 edition of Rust in Blockchain,
the chillest newsletter about the chillest tech.
[Previous: #21](/newsletters/more-rust-and-blockchains/).

There are many blockchains written in Rust now,
and quite a few blockchains that run Rust smart contracts.
It's hard to keep up, but we try.
In this month's newsletter we note 21 of them,
but there are more than that.

To reduce the manual work of keeping up with so many projects,
we are changing the format of the "Project Updates" section.

Going forward, we will include the GitHub stats for all Rust blockchains
that demonstrate significant development activity,
but will not source news, blogs, and pull request links for most projects,
unless those items have been submitted to the newsletter via pull request,
instructions for which [are on the website][ribcontrib].

[ribcontrib]: https://rustinblockchain.org/contributing/

Pull requests to add project updates and other interesting links are very welcome.
Next month's draft is always posted immediately
after the previous month,
and all a contributor needs to do is fill in a line of markdown
in their favorite project's section,
then submit a PR.

The end result may actually be that this section is more useful than in the past,
as there are far fewer low quality links to e.g. project pull requests.
Have a look at the difference this month,
and let us know what you think of the change in the [Telegram group][ribtg].

## Thanks

Thanks to contributors:
[Ernest Kissiedu][contributor-ek],
[Max Wegman][contributor-mw],
[NiklasHusten][contributor-nh],
[Brian Anderson][contributorba], and [Aimee Zhu][contributoraz].
Thank you for your help!

RiB needs help to keep up with Rust blockchain projects. 
If you follow a particular project, or otherwise find information 
that is beneficial to the Rust & blockchain community, 
please contribute to the next issue
by submitting a PR to the [#23 draft](https://github.com/rust-in-blockchain/Rust-in-Blockchain/tree/master/draft).

## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain project. This month that project is…

[Noir].

Noir is a language and compiler for building zero-knowledge proofs.
It is designed to work with multiple proof-generating backends,
the first of which is for [barretenberg],
as used by the [Aztec Network][aztec].

It [has some preliminary documentation][noirdocs] that is possible to follow for someone without expertise in zero knowledge proofs.

As a generalized language with intent to support multiple proof systems,
this seems like a promising project to learn about zero knowledge proofs,
independent of specific blockchains.
