Thank you for your help!

RiB needs help to keep up with Rust blockchain projects. 
If you follow a particular project, or otherwise find information 
that is beneficial to the Rust & blockchain community, 
please contribute to the next issue
by submitting a PR to the [next draft](https://github.com/rust-in-blockchain/Rust-in-Blockchain/tree/master/draft).

## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain project. This month that project is…

[teleport-transactions](https://github.com/bitcoin-teleport/teleport-transactions/).

This is an implementation in Rust of [CoinSwap], a long-discussed, but never implemented technique
for improving the privacy and fungibility of Bitcoin. It involves an interactive agreement between
two parties, performed over Tor, that results in exchanging ownership of two different addresses.
